 Welcome everyone to the Bat Decisions vlog season 2. That's right, if you guys are OG Bat Decisions fans, then you would know that Mian Farad actually started this channel with daily vlogs over 40 days, right? 45. Yeah, we got Farad as the cameraman right now. Hello, we're here. We just filmed our life for the first 45 days until we found out that we'd like to make Unreal Engine tutorials and do Gaussian Splat videos. But after we moved to Dubai, we were working on a lot of different projects, exciting projects, but we couldn't film it all for you. And that was unfortunate. We wanted to share everything with you, all the struggles, all the failures and all the victories. They were also valuable, but we don't have it. So guess what? We did set the bring back the vlogs and this beautiful music at the back. Can you guys hear it? I hope you can. I don't think so. Sounds very dramatic now. We want to bring back the vlogs because we want to show you our life. Everything that we do so that you can learn from the mistakes that we make and also enjoy the good times with us. So Farad, what's the plan? So since we are going back to vlogging, it's going to be weekly vlogs, not daily vlogs anymore because we have a lot of works during the week, but for the next few days, before we go back to Canada, we need to upgrade our studio setup. That's the first thing we need to do. And tonight we are going to play some paddle games where I'm going to roast Farad. Alright, let's introduce you two. They want it only. I still don't know how to use this camera. Ballant. What's up, man? So he's here to help us set up this bad boy. Ballant needs to educate us on everything that's going on here, but. Ballant. I thought you know how to set this up. Why? What the fuck? Ballant. What's going on today? So today we are going to install some new SSDs for your PCs. We are going to build a 10-inch network for you. Oh yeah. We are also going to set up a nice device serving for the new content that you are going to prepare it. I love that. I was on track for the last two years. Dude, I've been working. I've been telling the guys I've been working on 30 gigabytes of storage. For the last six months, just deleting the project file, bringing it another one, it's been crazy. So we are going to install the SSD in this portable drive and this is what we are going to use to mirror everything from the old drive to the new one. I'd like to check out how many, how much storage do we have here. 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 terabyte HDD, two terabyte SSD, another four terabyte, another two terabyte and two more two terabytes over there. I've never seen this much storage amount of, I think it's finally enough. Yes. New 990 Pro. It also has a heat sink on it. So if you're not hit up, heat up. You see how freaking dirty this is? That's not my fault. I swear. It's all the work. It's all the work. This is because of you guys, all the YouTube videos, all the renders. It's because of you guys. What is that? Why is it like a perfect circle? So we've completed the first step, which is cleaning the PC. Now what are we going to do? We are going to install the new SSD. The second slot. Should I? No. It's time to get the NAS off. What are you clapping for? For another store. No, you do. Bullin has been telling us about the NAS. Six months ago. I remember we went to a Shisha place and he made it. Six months later we go for it. You'll be clapping like this all the time. Every single time I think we'll use it will be like bullets for the best. Let's do the field. Yes. You have three spin-units. So this is for the drive. This is where we're going to put our drive. We have six of these. We're going to go in grade five and then we're going to have one for the backup and then all the others for the storage. This way you'll end up around like 45 derbytes, usable data. Then one backup drive which can be played any time and then you can just replace it and then give you the whole array. Two fans at the back. Two fans at the back and then we have two slots for SSDs. Which is going to be the cache. These ports are just general one gigabit ports that you can ten or one use. These are one GB but we're going to install the 10 GB expansion card which is a BCIE. Everything you have to add and then X. This will go here and then you will get the 10 GB. Then later on if you want to expand the NAS we're going to be able to use these connectors and then add more. More NAS and more storage units. Wow. So I have a question. Once you connect that then the speed rises and then you can technically edit it real time from the NAS. Yeah, but different on the files and then obviously the bit rate of the footage and everything. But on my setup I'm reaching around like one GB speed with these. You know? Sounds like it's in there. It's a tanky card. Yeah. And this is a mixed state controller. Yeah. How do you say it's a proprietary. I can't pronounce it but proprietary. But the single log is making it so you have to use single log. So we are putting two 16 GB kits in here. So from what I heard from Baldy and the RAM helps us multitask quicker even with here. So when you're switching out from files and multiple editors over here at the same time, you can then access those files quicker. Am I right? Yeah. Pretty much. Yeah. Yes. So we are now starting to install all the drives into the six base that we have. So what is this? These are 10 terabyte each. These are data center drives so for enterprise use. How are you happy with 10 terabytes finally? Extremely. But that's not all. We've got a lot more than 10 terabytes. This is how it goes back. So you can slide it back, push it in and then lock it in place. But one more thing before we finish with our drives, we need to install the SSDs into those M2 slots. So this is going to be 24-7 on. Yeah, 365. This you just plug it, start it and then it's done. So one thing we were checking just now is the speed of our SSD currently at about 400 right there. And we're going to upgrade this to up to about 7000. I'm opening up the 10 gear, but thank you for back. Thank you for back today. Today I can't talk. Thank you a bit, network adapter PCIe. Here it is. Beauty. This is going to go in. How does it feel installing and setting up your computer on your own with your own hands? Hey, don't show up on it. Because the computer doesn't have a 10-through bit. So we need that to be able to transfer data quickly to the nest and back. Where did you get that information? Oh wow. Alright, so this is the fresh computer formatted. Ready to go with six terabytes of storage, all SSD. Super fast. And now we are connecting it to the nest. Bond has been trying freaking hard to make this work. And we made the NAS work, but my PCS had some issues. Previously one of the SSDs was not working. So right now we reformatted everything in solving the new SSDs and we realized that the problem wasn't with the SSD because right now the computer keeps crashing. And the guess is that the PSU is not delivering the right power. Yes, the new PSU perhaps. What's up? Get the f- what are you showing me? Buy a Mac. Buy a Mac? Easy life. Can you upgrade your Mac? Buy a Mac? Can you play games on your Mac? Buy a Mac. Can you play games on your Mac? Buy a Mac. Can you insult plug-ins for Unreal Engine and your Mac? Two cables. SSD HDD motherboard PSU buy a Mac. Think difficult. I think that the button just fixed it. What do you do? So actually we were having low voltages in the BIOS and then we were thinking like it could be my because of the extension cables. And then we removed them, we just connected the PSU directly to the motherboard. And then now the readings are good. And then it's also showing promising signs. Look at this scene. If it works, and now the screen is opening 17 GB, it's like about 5 seconds. And it works. And it works. It's like it's working. These are just for aesthetic purposes. Yes. So we just got finished setting up the entire NAS with the computers and the test here to see the level of success is to go ahead and download the file on my computer. And then put it onto the NAS and have that hot immediately have it in his computer. In which engine do you want the NAS? Yeah, put it in the V2 results. Let's go. Let's go. Ballad, you ready? Three, two, one. I'm going to now drop the file into the NAS in three, two, one, copy. Okay, it's pasted. Let's go. That's how fast it did. Okay, I got it. Dropping it. Change. Drop it. Drop it. Let's see. Wow. Dude, that was it. That's like, that's like two seconds. This is the entire recording for one of the guests. Wow. Wow. This was crazy. This is literally a simple copy-pacing something from my computer to the NAS and found it downloading it almost immediately and then editing it on the NAS in DaVinci. So you don't even use the local drive. Ballad, you are the savior of that decision studio. Now, well, how we are celebrating? Three, two, one. End snap. And here. Celebration for the center of the system. This is the prize. Kabobs. Got to do it the old-fashioned way. We are now on the way to the paddle court for our last paddle session here in Dubai. Fadduk, you're going to lose. You're going to lose. You're going to lose. You're going to lose. You're going to lose. You lost the first time. You lost the last time. We didn't even play last time. We did play last time in the warm-up session. And we finally made it to ballers. This is where we've learned paddle. And this is our peak's paddles every single day. Let's bowl shit. Hello. Hello. Hello boss. This is the champion, the person who introduced paddle to us. The coach of paddle. Yes. Hey, Mayor. Who's going to win today? Faradamai. Hey. How was it? Go last time. I won. We're doing a quick warm-up session before Alex arrives right now. Matt here and paddle are here. We're waiting for the court to open up because it's pretty busy. And for anybody that doesn't know, paddle is actually one of the most famous sports here in Dubai. If not the most famous, I mean everybody that we know plays it. And they've been asking us here and there left and right to start playing the game. We started learning about it just a couple of months ago. Actually no, I think about a month and a half ago. We went through five sessions. And now, a lot of things is better than I mean, which is completely false. Faradamai is definitely worse than me. I was just telling them about how we started doing paddle just about a month ago. Yeah. Took training sessions here at ballers. And we were just telling everybody how famous it is here in Dubai. How everyone fucking plays it. So we've got to bring it to Canada. We just finished a paddle game and I wanted to introduce you to the most beautiful must-session in the world. The production videos of Alex out of the office. My name is Alex out of the office. I'm one of their best friends. Yes! And one of their brothers from Lebanon. They don't invite me to parties. I just bump into them. But I love them so much. Every party I bump into them. But I love them so much. And he's promised to find me a Lebanese girlfriend. Yeah. We have Mr. Mario. Mario, how was the game today? It was amazing. Amazing. It was so challenging. It was freaking good. Who won? I have no idea. I have no idea. I see the ludo over there. I see them as well. I see them. We're going to put like an arrow. They're acting like they won. Go try that. So it is not one hour after we finished paddle. And I'm looking at Pato's face and I begin to see the letter L. Pato is just unhappy about the loss. Because we clean this ass off the court. Yo, Pato, anything you want to say? Pato. Anything you want to say? Nothing, see? Luzas usually don't like to talk. So that's okay. You may see Pato tomorrow. It's okay, guys. It's 24 hours exactly after we have installed our NAS and we want to show you guys a real test of how fast the system works. So right now you're looking at a shared folder called Test Between Me and Tire. It's currently empty. And what we're going to do is we're going to take one of the video files from my old YouTube videos right here that is about three gigabytes large and drop it into that shared folder. And the test is going to be to see how fast Farrot is going to have it in this computer. Plus, can you edit on top of it immediately in the Vinci? So usually we use either a pen drive or a Google drive to do this transfer. We'll take a couple of minutes. Yes, see. So we have this footage. Let's start the timer in three, two, one. Okay. It's going in one view by the second and the transfer is done. The transfer is done. Farrot already? Wait wait wait. I can see it here. Farrot already has the footage. Let's take it to the Vinci, Jagan Drop. It's here. And I can edit on top of it. Can you zoom in and scrub? Can you zoom in and scrub on it? And then see the playback? Wow. 4k footage. Dude! This is it! Do you see that? Do you see that? You just hit the camera. You just hit the camera. You just hit the camera. You're the by-mode going back home. Second last thing, the by-mode going back to Canada in two days. Oh, fountain. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, fountain. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Actually, this is good. It feels like we're in Disneyland. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like this song. It's so fun, like cool. Life is good, everybody. Don't forget to dance. I'm going to the world.
