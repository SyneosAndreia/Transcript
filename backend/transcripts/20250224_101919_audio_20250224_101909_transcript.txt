 Stop hiring humans. That's the tagline of artisan in AI startup is running the most insane ads I have ever seen. First of all, Ava in this ad looks fricking scary. In this photo, we have our lovely gal Ava and another one of these ads sitting next to someone on the street who possibly had their job taken by Ava. The text of this ad is artisans won't complain about work life out, referring to AI robots as artisans. I can all think of a caption that is more Scrooge money duck evil villain, but actually, I can think of something more Scrooge McDuck evil money bags and it is artisan zoom camera will never not be working today. Do I even need to say that an AI doesn't have a zoom camera? If I jump into a zoom and mother fricking Ava is there, I'm leaving the zoom. Here's another one, artisans won't come into work hungover. All right, well they can come into work with a 404 error. Why can't the ad you say artisans can work 247? Instead of making fun of humans for human traits.
