Source: Video 2: 10% of devs do *nothing*?

 are 10% of programmers not actually doing any work. There's this research study coming out of Stanford that's going viral on the internet. And by the way, I'm putting research study in air quotes because it's basically a camphographic posing as a research paper. But what the research slash camphographic says is that 9.5% of software engineers are ghost engineers or they're not actually doing any real work. So he says specifically that these ghost engineers are making trivial changes like editing one line or character, pretending to work. I feel like this is a fundamental misunderstanding of what a software engineer does. Because one line changes can often be the most important changes. Changing one line is going to be like changing a config file somewhere where you're maybe giving more resources to a job that's failing. Maybe you got paid for that. And yes, that's a one line change. But you didn't just know where the file was and know what to change. You had to figure out what was going wrong with the job. All of that is intangible work that this guy is just not considering. If it's not obvious, the guy who made these viral tweets who's the first author on this paper is not a professional developer. He's actually an MBA, which in my opinion, an MBA grad is the natural enemy of the software engineer.
