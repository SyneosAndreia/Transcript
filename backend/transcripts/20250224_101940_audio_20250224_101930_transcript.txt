 There's a leaked email from Amazon this week where Amazon has asked its employees to stop eating so much fruit. If you're not aware, Amazon has historically not had as many free food, free drinks, free perks as other tech companies, because one of their principles is frugality. But something that they have had for a very long time is free bananas. So in places like Seattle, they're HQ, they would have these trucks, they would drive them around and they would give out bananas from the trucks. This is what the truck looks like. And so in Seattle, they have lots of different Amazon buildings so the people come out of the building, they go to the truck, they get their banana, then they would leave. But back to the fruit, there's this representative from Amazon who's in charge of his specific site and he's asking his employees to stop eating so much fruit. There's only one fruit per person per day. Says, when you are asked by teammates to pick up on their behalf, encourage them to get up, get down, and pick it up themselves. It's not only more sustainable, it's also healthier for them to proceed that way. I am not quite getting the more sustainable thing unless we're like driving our SUVs to the fruit. And then I like that he's saying it's healthier. Listen, if you are so concerned about my health, you should let me eat more fruit.
