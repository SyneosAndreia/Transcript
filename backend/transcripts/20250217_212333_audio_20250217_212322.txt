 Hey, you call me into your office. Notice to glitch with the web app. All right, so we laid off the whole web app, tube, so I don't know if we're gonna be able to get that fix. Yeah, I don't know how to do that. I'm just the assistant. You don't pay me, you're really enough to do that. What recent artist should we own word? We're not really doing that anymore, right? Cause we laid off all the sales folks. But we got the Nutella Swift album. She was already on the platform, but she stayed on the platform. What does Mark think about this? So Mark doesn't work here anymore. You fired Mark. Layed off Mark. So I could DMM on LinkedIn, but I don't think he's gonna respond to me. No, you're right, it wasn't that many people. It shouldn't be this disruptive. It was 16% though. Oh, 17%. Why was it disruptive? No, I think that's like a super valid and good and fair question. I just thought, so they worked here. And so then therefore they were doing a job.
